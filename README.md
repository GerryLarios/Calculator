The program shows the Pre Order and Post Order of the tree.

### Linked list

Every element (number or operator) is a "node" that has previous and next element.

### Tree

Depends of the operator, we build a tree which has the elements of the linked list.

### LIFO

This stack helps to make the operations (depends of the order).
